      Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia
      and Consonantia, there<br />
      live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the
      coast of the Semantics, a<br />
      large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and
      supplies it with the<br />
      necessary regelialia.

      listen. She packed her<br />

      until a few insidious<br />
      Copy Writers ambushed her, made her drunk with Longe and Parole and
      dragged her into their<br />
      agency, where they abused her for their projects again and again. And if
      she hasn’t been<br />
      rewritten, then they are still using her.

      have been rewritten a thousand times and everything that was left from its
      origin would be the word "and" and the Little Blind Text should turn
      around and return to its own, safe country.
